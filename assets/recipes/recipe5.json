I started searching what to do with it and came here to try this interesting slaw, and boy does this hit it out of the park! I did make some substitutions based on what I had on hand, but I think that's what recipes are for, starting points. I used the kohlrabi, a gala apple, julienned provolone cheese, a finely minced wedge of preserved lemon, extra virgin olive oil, and a couple grinds of black pepper. It is so refreshing, crunchy, delicious, and a totally different and pleasurable taste on my palate.

I also chopped in the Kohlrabi leaves. I gave my son a taste of a Kohlrabi matchstick before dressing it. He grimaced. But the salad totally transformed it, and it elevated our 4th of July barbecue to another level. (I also made barbecued chicken legs for the first time ever. The two were a great complement to one another).
